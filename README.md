# ðŸš— Car Dashboard UI â€“ Qt/QML Project

As someone curious about UI design, automotive tech and embedded systems, I wanted to explore QML for building a real-time car dashboard experience. This project helped me dive deeper into Qt's frontend capabilities and animation handling. This is a personal project where I designed and built a car dashboard interface using **Qt QML**. It features an interactive **navigation view with map integration** and a **music player** with a sleek, modern UI.
